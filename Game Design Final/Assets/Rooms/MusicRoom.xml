	<name>MusicRoom</name>
	<description>The Music Room is equally as unused as half of the other rooms in the mansion. White walls decorated with gold trimming and cliche fleur-de-lis patterns match the white plush carpet. A harp sits in one corner of the room, overshadowed by the 3 grand pianos: 1 Black, 1 White, and 1 Almond Brown.

Assassin: ...
Assassin: He doesn’t even know how to play ONE piano; why does he need THREE?
Assassin: *sigh* Whatever. At least there aren’t any messes to deal with here.</description>
