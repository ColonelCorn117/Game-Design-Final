			<additionalDescription>A set of harp strings hangs from the vase.
	
Assassin: [Hiding these here is a surprisingly clever idea. Nobody pays attention to the decorations in the hallways around here, and Lord Borkus's harpist has trouble seeing anything more than a foot away from him. If I hadn't spotted these strings, they probably would have gone unnoticed for weeks.]</additionalDescription>
