	<name>An Endless Void</name>
	<description>You stand before an abyss of nothingness, and can't help but feel that the abyss is gazing directly into your soul. 

Its whisper is almost inaudible, but you know without a doubt that the message conveyed is "Get back to work."

You see a doorway to your left, no doubt leading back to the mansion's entrance.
