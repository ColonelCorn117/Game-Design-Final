	<description>Lord Borkus is sitting at his desk when you walk in.

Lord Borkus: "It goes without saying that I am very displeased, Assassin."
  
Assassin: [No shit…]

Assassin: [How the hell do I get out of this…?]

Assassin: [I’ll just tell him what actually happened. That’ll at least direct some of the fire away from me]
