	<description>Lord Borkus: "Damned wenches! I’ll show them what it means to defy me! I’ll give you one chance to redeem yourself, Assassin. Go kill every last one of them. Right now!"

Assassin: "Wait, what?"

Lord Borkus: "Kill them! I’ve had it with their worthlessness! Get rid of them!"

The code of an assassin never permits you to fail. You leave to carry out your duties, silently wondering if you should at least let Maidrilla go free...she was nice after all.

You got the Neutral Ending. At least you had the chance to set Maidrilla free. Try better next time.
