	<description>No words could possibly express the amount of ice cold rage you feel. You move toward the door of the office. Lord Borkus puts down his pen.

Lord Borkus: Is there something wrong?”

You say nothing, but do stop to stare at a very expensive-looking, fancy vase that sits on a decorate display pillar next to the door. 

Lord Borkus: What are you doing? What’s the matter with you?

Congratulations! You’ve gotten the Good Ending!
