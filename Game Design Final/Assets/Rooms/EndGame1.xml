	<description>Assassin: [Finally…they’re gone]

The guests have left. Every moment of the meeting with Lord Borkus was agonizing to watch, forced to follow along silently as they were given a grand tour of the mansion.

Assassin: [I need to start being more selective of what jobs I take on…this has been ridiculous…]

Lord Borkus returns to the office, closing the door behind him and moving to sit at his desk. He is quiet for a minute, before turning around in his chair to face you with a pleased smile on his face.

Lord Borkus: "Everything has gone perfectly. Negotiations were successful. They will be investing in my new business venture."
