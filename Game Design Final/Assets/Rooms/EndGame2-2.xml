	<description>Assassin: "I have an explanation if you will hear me out, Sir..."

Lord Borkus: "Speak quickly."

Assassin: "The maid staff were…extremely angry after the meeting this morning. They decided to go on strike and began to destroy your mansion. I did what I could to stop them and clean up their messes, but it was too much for me to handle alone. I deeply apologize, Sir."

Lord Borkus looks drastically less happy than before.

Lord Borkus: "Why did you not inform me that these things were happening?!"

Assassin: "I didn’t want to disturb you, Sir. "
