	<description>Assassin: "That wine is a vintage, limited bottle. Don’t give him the satisfaction of saying you wasted it. Why not drink it instead? Not only does he lose a valuable maid, but he also loses a delicious wine that you get to take instead."

The Maid hesitates, staring at the glass with an expression that shows she is considering the idea offered.

Maid: "You won’t tell him?"

Assassin: "Nope. I think he’s a dick too. Drink away and just don’t get caught on your way out."</description>
