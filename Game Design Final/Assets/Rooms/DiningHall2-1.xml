	The Maid hesitates, staring at the glass with an expression that shows she is considering the idea offered.

Maid: You won’t tell him?

Assassin: Nope. I think he’s a dick too. Drink away and just don’t get caught on your way out.

	The Maid takes another moment to think, before putting the glass to her lips and drinking the whole thing.

Maid: You’re right. I’m gonna drink this whole bottle and he won’t get to have a single drop!

With a smirk on her face, the Maid struts out of the room. No messes have been made.

Assassin: Phew. Crisis avoided.
