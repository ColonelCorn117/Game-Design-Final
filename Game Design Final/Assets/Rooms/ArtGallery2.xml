	<description>Assassin: [As much as I would also love for that thing to be burned, I really can't let her do that...]

Assassin: "You know that's acrylic, right?"
	
Maid: "So what? What's that supposed to mean?"

Assassin: "You're gonna be here a while if you want to burn that. You're better off burning the painting over the-I MEAN DOWNSTAIRS in the Servant's Quarters, which totally has paintings!"

Maid: "That's a really good idea, Mr. Tall Scary Person! I'll go do that!"

You take the opportunity to surreptitiously relieve the maid of the ligher as she marches out the door.</description>
