Assassin: Stop right now!

Maid: Huh? What do you want?

Assassin: Please don’t dump that wine on the tablecloth.

Maid: What? Why?

Assassin: [Because I don’t want to clean that shit up...]

Assassin: It’s not worth it.

Maid: Yes it is! Lord Borkus is jerk! We’ll show him how important we are!

Assassin: [I have to negotiate this somehow.]

Assassin: That wine is a vintage, limited bottle. Don’t give him the satisfaction of saying you wasted it. Why not drink it instead? Not only does he lose a valuable maid, but he also loses a delicious wine that you get to take instead.
