	<description>In a flash, the maid appears at your side, her eyes gaining an unsettling glimmer. Killing intent fills the air, freezing you in place.

Maid: "Give me the bread!"

She pulls out a butter knife, spreading the jam over her newly acquired loaf, and skips away, munching away at her prize.</description>
