In a flash, the maid appears at your side, her eyes gaining an unsettling glimmer. Killing intent fills the air, freezing you in place.

Maid: Give me the bread!

You see your life flash before your eyes, and decide that your head is worth more than a single loaf of bread. As you hand over a loaf of bread, the maid's demeanor shifts abruptly. She pulls out a butter knife, spreading the jam over her newly acquired loaf, and skips away, munching away at her prize.
