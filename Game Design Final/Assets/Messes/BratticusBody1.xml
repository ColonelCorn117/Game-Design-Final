				<description>Assassin: I'm not touching him until I'm ready to move him. I'll need some way to keep him from moving if he wakes up and I need to make sure the path to his room is clear. I can't just shove Lord Borkus's child in some closet and I can't just magic him up the laundry chute. I'm an assassin, not a magician.</description>
